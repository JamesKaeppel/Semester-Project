## Manipulating data
```{r}
#Here we can see the average dollar amount a home buyer will pay per square foot
housing_project %>% 
  summarise(
    avg_price_sqft = mean(price / sqft_living))

#This shows us the average price of a home in each of the five condition states
housing_project %>%
  group_by(condition) %>% 
  summarise(avg_price_condition = mean(price)) 

#average price per floor
housing_project %>%
  group_by(floors) %>% 
  summarise(avg_price_floor = mean(price)) 

#Here we see the affects of sqaure foot on price
ggplot(housing_project) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = price, x = sqft_living))

#This code shows the affects of conditon on price
ggplot(housing_project) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = condition, y = price))

ggplot(housing_project) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = yr_built, y = price))
```

## Summarising Data
```{r}
#This code shows us several summations of the price variable
housing_project %>%
  summarise(avg_price = mean(price),
  median_price = median(price),
  max_price = max(price),
  min_price = min(price),
  stdv_price = sd(price))

#This code filters out outlighter prices
filter(housing_project, price <= 3000000 | 10000 <= price)

housing_data1 <- filter(housing_project, price >= 3000000) %>% 
  summarise(avg_price = mean(price),
  median_price = median(price),
  max_price = max(price),
  min_price = min(price),
  stdv_price = sd(price))
